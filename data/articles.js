    text: 'It\'s not unusual for young people to experience\"the blues" or feel\"down in the dumps" occasionally. Adolescence is always an unsettling time, with the many physical, emotional, psychological and social changes that accompany this stage of life. \n\nUnrealistic academic, social, or family expectations can create a strong sense of rejection and can lead to deep disappointment. When things go wrong at school or at home, teens often overreact. Many young people feel that life is not fair or that things\"never go their way." They feel\"stressed out" and confused. To make matters worse, teens are bombarded by conflicting messages from parents, friends and society. Today\'s teens see more of what life has to offer — both good and bad — on television, at school, in magazines and on the Internet. They are also forced to learn about the threat of AIDS, even if they are not sexually active or using drugs.\n\nTeens need adult guidance more than ever to understand all the emotional and physical changes they are experiencing. When teens\' moods disrupt their ability to function on a day-to-day basis, it may indicate a serious emotional or mental disorder that needs attention — adolescent depression. Parents or caregivers must take action.\n\nDealing With Adolescent Pressure\nWhen teens feel down, there are ways they can cope with these feelings to avoid serious depression. All of these suggestions help develop a sense of acceptance and belonging that is so important to adolescents.\n\nTry to make new friends. Healthy relationships with peers are central to teens\' self-esteem and provide an important social outlet. \nParticipate in sports, job, school activities or hobbies. Staying busy helps teens focus on positive activities rather than negative feelings or behaviors.\n\nJoin organizations that offer programs for young people. Special programs geared to the needs of adolescents help develop additional interests.\n\nAsk a trusted adult for help. When problems are too much to handle alone, teens should not be afraid to ask for help.\n\nBut sometimes, despite everyone\'s best efforts, teens become depressed. Many factors can contribute to depression. Studies show that some depressed people have too much or too little of certain brain chemicals. Also, a family history of depression may increase the risk for developing depression. Other factors that can contribute to depression are difficult life events (such as death or divorce), side-effects from some medications and negative thought patterns.\n\nRecognizing Adolescent Depression\nAdolescent depression is increasing at an alarming rate. Recent surveys indicate that as many as one in five teens suffers from clinical depression. This is a serious problem that calls for prompt, appropriate treatment. Depression can take several forms, including bipolar disorder (formally called manic-depression), which is a condition that alternates between periods of euphoria and depression.\n\nDepression can be difficult to diagnose in teens because adults may expect teens to act moody. Also, adolescents do not always understand or express their feelings very well. They may not be aware of the symptoms of depression and may not seek help.\n\nThese symptoms may indicate depression, particularly when they last for more than two weeks:\n\nPoor performance in school\nWithdrawal from friends and activities\nSadness and hopelessness\nLack of enthusiasm, energy or motivation\nAnger and rage\n\nIf you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, call 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255).',

    text: 'Abnormal is the new normal — at least for mental health. Only a small share of the population stays mentally healthy from age 11 to 38. Everyone else experiences a mental illness at some point, a new study finds.\n\n\"For many, an episode of mental disorder is like influenza, bronchitis, kidney stones, a broken bone or other [common] conditions,\" says Jonathan Schaefer. He is a psychologist at Duke University. A coauthor of the study, he notes that \"Sufferers experience impaired functioning. Many seek medical care, but most recover.\"\n\nThe study looked at 988 people who lived in New Zealand. Only 171 — or about one in six people —experienced no anxiety disorders, depression or other mental ailments from late childhood to middle age. Of the rest, half experienced a mental disorder that lasted a short time. This was typically just a bout of depression, anxiety or substance abuse. The person then recovered.\n\nThe remaining 408 people — roughly two out of every five — experienced one or more mental disorders that lasted at least several years. Their diagnoses included more severe conditions. These may have included bipolar and psychotic disorders.\n\nSchaefer and his colleagues shared their findings in the February Journal of Abnormal Psychology.\n\nBy the numbers…\n\nThe researchers analyzed data on people born between April 1972 and March 1973 in Dunedin, New Zealand. Each person\'s general health and behavior was assessed 13 times from birth to age 38. Mental health was assessed eight times from age 11 onward.\n\nPrevious studies had linked several traits with a lower chance of developing mental disorders. These included growing up in an unusually well-off family and enjoying really good physical health. Scoring very high on intelligence tests also has been linked to good mental health. Surprisingly, however, the New Zealanders who stayed mentally healthy scored no better of those qualities than anyone else.\n\nInstead, people with good mental health tended to have personality traits that gave them some sort of advantage. Those traits started emerging in childhood, the surveys showed. These people rarely expressed strongly negative emotions. They also tended to have lots of friends and very good self-control. Those with lasting mental health also had relatively few family members with mental disorders, compared with their peers.\n\nThere were some benefits in adulthood for those who always had good mental health. These people had, on average, more education, better jobs and higher-quality relationships. They also reported more satisfaction with their lives than the others did. But lasting mental health doesn\'t guarantee an exceptional sense of well-being, Schaefer points out. Nearly one-in-four people never diagnosed with mental illness scored below the entire group\'s average score for life satisfaction.\n\nLess surprising was the 83 percent overall rate of mental disorders. That matches recent estimates from four other long-term projects. Two had focused on Americans. One looked at people in Switzerland. The last was another study from New Zealand. These studies followed people for 12 to 30 years. And over that follow-up, between 61 percent and 85 percent of the participants reported having at least some mental disorders.\n\nSuch high rates also were reported in an earlier study, from 1962. It had surveyed a random mix of people living on the island of Manhattan in New York City. Many researchers had doubted that study\'s findings, however. Why? It had relied on a diagnostic system that was less strict than the ones used to evaluate the people in New Zealand, explains William Eaton. In fact, he says, the Manhattan study now appears to have been on the right track. Eaton is an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, Md.\n\nThere is often a stigma attached to mental illness. But if more people realize that most will eventually develop some mental disorder, at least briefly, that stigma might fall, Eaton suspects.\n\nRonald Kessler is also an epidemiologist. He works at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Mass. Kessler directs U.S. surveys of mental disorders. He suspects the numbers of people who experience a mental disorder may be even higher than what was reported in these studies.\n\nMany people that seemed to have enduring mental health in these studies may not have. They may have developed brief mental disorders that got overlooked, he says. It might have been something such as a couple of weeks of serious depression after a romantic breakup.\n\nFocusing on those rare cases of lasting mental health may not be the best idea, he says. \"The more interesting thing is to compare people with persistent mental illness to those with temporary disorders.\"',

    name: '6 Ways Social Media Affects Our Mental Health',

    text: 'Health experts love to say that sitting is the new smoking. Given the number of diseases to which sitting is linked, and the number of people it apparently kills every year, sitting is one of the worst things we can do for health. But possibly as concerning is the thing that we often do while we\'re sitting: Mindlessly scrolling through our social media feeds when we have a few spare minutes (or for some, hours). And as we probably know intuitively, and as the research is confirming, it\'s not the best habit when it comes to our collective psychology.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics has warnedabout the potential for negative effects of social media in young kids and teens, including cyber-bullying and \"Facebook depression.\" But the same risks may be true for adults, across generations. Here\'s a quick run-down of the studies that have shown that social media isn\'t very good for mental well-being, and in some ways, it can be pretty damaging.\n\nIt\'s addictive\nExperts have not been in total agreement on whether internet addiction is a real thing, let alone social media addiction, but there\'s some good evidence that both may exist. A review study from Nottingham Trent University looked back over earlier research on the psychological characteristics, personality and social media use. The authors conclude that \"it may be plausible to speak specifically of \'Facebook Addiction Disorder\'…because addiction criteria, such as neglect of personal life, mental preoccupation, escapism, mood modifying experiences, tolerance and concealing the addictive behavior, appear to be present in some people who use [social networks] excessively.\" (They also found that the motivation for people\'s excessive use of social networks differs depending on certain traits—introverts and extroverts use it for different reasons, as do people with narcissistic traits. But that deserves a piece of its own.)\n\nAnd studies have confirmed that people tend to undergo a kind of withdrawal: A study a few years ago from Swansea University found that people experienced the psychological symptoms of withdrawal when they stopped using (this went for all internet use, not just social media). Their recent follow-up study found that when people stop using, they also undergo small but measurable physiological effects. Study author Phil Reed said, \"We have known for some time that people who are over-dependent on digital devices report feelings of anxiety when they are stopped from using them, but now we can see that these psychological effects are accompanied by actual physiological changes.\" Whether this is true of social media per se is unclear right now, but anecdotal evidence suggests it may be.\n\nIt triggers more sadness, less well-being\nThe more we use social media, the less happy we seem to be. One study a few years ago found that Facebook use was linked to both less moment-to-moment happiness and less life satisfaction—the more people used Facebook in a day, the more these two variables dropped off. The authors suggest this may have to do with the fact that Facebook conjures up a perception of social isolation, in a way that other solitary activities don\'t. \"On the surface,\" the authors write, \"Facebook provides an invaluable resource for fulfilling such needs by allowing people to instantly connect. Rather than enhancing well-being, as frequent interactions with supportive \'offline\' social networks powerfully do, the current findings demonstrate that interacting with Facebook may predict the opposite result for young adults—it may undermine it.\"\n\nIn fact, another study found that social media use is linked to greater feelings of social isolation. The team looked at how much people used 11 social media sites, including Facebook, Twitter, Google+, YouTube, LinkedIn, Instagram, Pinterest, Tumblr, Vine, Snapchat and Reddit, and correlated this with their \"perceived social isolation.\" Not surprisingly, it turned out that the more time people spent on these sites, the more socially isolated they perceivedthemselves to be. And perceived social isolation is one of the worst things for us, mentally and physically.\n\nComparing our lives with others is mentally unhealthy\nPart of the reason Facebook makes people feelsocially isolated (even though they may not actually be) is the comparison factor. We fall into the trap of comparing ourselves to others as we scroll through our feeds, and make judgements about how we measure up. One study looked at how we make comparisons to others posts, in \"upward\" or \"downward\" directions—that is, feeling that we\'re either better or worse off than our friends. It turned out that both types of comparisons made people feel worse, which is surprising, since in real life, only upward comparisons (feeling another person has it better than you) makes people feel bad. But in the social network world, it seems that any kind of comparison is linked to depressive symptoms.\n\nIt can lead to jealousy—and a vicious cycle\nIt\'s no secret that the comparison factor in social media leads to jealousy—most people will admit that seeing other people\'s tropical vacations and perfectly behaved kids is envy-inducing. Studies have certainly shown that social media use triggers feelings of jealousy. The authors of one study, looking at jealousy and other negative feelings while using Facebook, wrote that \"This magnitude of envy incidents taking place on FB alone is astounding, providing evidence that FB offers a breeding ground for invidious feelings.\" They add that it can become a vicious cycle: feeling jealous can make a person want to make his or her own life look better, and post jealousy-inducing posts of their own, in an endless circle of one-upping and feeling jealous.\n\nAnother study looked at the connection between envy and depression in Facebook use and, interestingly, discovered that envy mediates the Facebook-depression link. That is, when envy is controlled for, Facebook isn\'t so depressing. So it may be the envy that\'s largely to blame in the depression-Facebook connection.\n\nWe get caught in the delusion of thinking it will help\nPart of the unhealthy cycle is that we keep coming back to social media, even though it doesn\'t make us feel very good. This is probably because of what\'s known as a forecasting error: Like a drug, we think getting a fix will help, but it actually makes us feel worse, which comes down to an error in our ability to predict our own response. One study looked at how people feel after using Facebook and how they think they\'ll feel going in. Like other studies suggested, the participants in this one almost always felt worse after using it, compared to people engaging in other activities. But a follow-up experiment showed that people generally believed that they\'d feel better after using, not worse. Which of course turns out not to be the case at all, and sounds a lot like the pattern in other types of addiction.\n\nMore friends on social doesn\'t mean you\'re more social\nA couple of years ago, a study found that more friends on social media doesn\'t necessarily mean you have a better social life—there seems to be a cap on the number of friends a person\'s brain can handle, and it takes actual social interaction (not virtual) to keep up these friendships. So feeling like you\'re being social by being on Facebook doesn\'t work. Since loneliness is linked to myriad health and mental health problems (including early death), getting real social support is important. Virtual friend time doesn\'t have the therapeutic effect as time with real friends.\n\n* * *\n\nAll of this is not to say that there\'s no benefit to social media—obviously it keeps us connected across great distances, and helps us find people we\'d lost touch with years ago. But getting on social when you have some time to kill, or, worse, need an emotional lift, is very likely a bad idea. And studies have found that taking a break from Facebook helps boost psychological well-being. If you\'re feeling brave, try taking a little break, and see how it goes. And if you\'re going to keep \"using,\" then at least try to use in moderation.',

    text: 'Over the past two decades, the positive psychology movement has brightened up psychological research with its science of happiness, human potential and flourishing. It argues that psychologists should not only investigate mental illness but also what makes life worth living.\n\nThe founding father of positive psychology, Martin Seligman, describes happiness as experiencing frequent positive emotions, such as joy, excitement and contentment, combined with deeper feelings of meaning and purpose. It implies a positive mindset in the present and an optimistic outlook for the future. Importantly, happiness experts have argued that happiness is not a stable, unchangeable trait but something flexible that we can work on and ultimately strive towards.\n\nI have been running happiness workshops for the last four years based on the evidence from the above field of psychology. The workshops are fun and I have earned a reputation as \"Mrs Happy\", but the last thing I would want anyone to believe is that I am happy all the time. Striving for a happy life is one thing, but striving to be happy all the time is unrealistic.\n\nRecent research  indicates that psychological flexibility is the key to greater happiness and well-being. For example, being open to emotional experiences and the ability to tolerate periods of discomfort can allow us to move towards a richer, more meaningful existence.\n\nStudies have demonstrated that the way we respond to the circumstances of our lives has more influence on our happiness than the events themselves. Experiencing stress, sadness and anxiety in the short term doesn\'t mean we can\'t be happy in the long term.\n\nTwo paths to happiness\nPhilosophically speaking there are two paths to feeling happy, the hedonistic and the eudaimonic. Hedonists take the view that in order to live a happy life we must maximise pleasure and avoid pain. This view is about satisfying human appetites and desires, but it is often short lived.\n\nIn contrast, the eudaimonic approach takes the long view. It argues that we should live authentically and for the greater good. We should pursue meaning and potential through kindness, justice, honesty and courage.\n\nIf we see happiness in the hedonistic sense, then we have to continue to seek out new pleasures and experiences in order to \"top up\" our happiness. We will also try to minimise unpleasant and painful feelings in order to keep our mood high.\n\nIf we take the eudaimonic approach, however, we strive for meaning, using our strengths to contribute to something greater than ourselves. This may involve unpleasant experiences and emotions at times, but often leads to deeper levels of joy and contentment. So leading a happy life is not about avoiding hard times; it is about being able to respond to adversity in a way that allows you to grow from the experience.\n\nGrowing from adversity\nResearch shows that experiencing adversity can actually be good for us, depending on how we respond to it. Tolerating distress can make us more resilient and lead us to take action in our lives, such as changing jobs or overcoming hardship.\n\nIn studies of people facing trauma, many describe their experience as a catalyst for profound change and transformation, leading to a phenomenon known as \"post-traumatic growth\". Often when people have faced difficulty, illness or loss, they describe their lives as happier and more meaningful as a result.\n\nUnlike feeling happy, which is a transient state, leading a happier life is about individual growth through finding meaning. It is about accepting our humanity with all its ups and downs, enjoying the positive emotions, and harnessing painful feelings in order to reach our full potential.',

    text: 'Many of us worry from time to time. We fret over finances, feel anxious about job interviews, or get nervous about social gatherings. These feelings can be normal or even helpful. They may give us a boost of energy or help us focus. But for people with anxiety disorders, they can be overwhelming.\n\nAnxiety disorders affect nearly 1 in 5 American adults each year. People with these disorders have feelings of fear and uncertainty that interfere with everyday activities and last for 6 months or more. Anxiety disorders can also raise your risk for other medical problems such as heart disease, diabetes, substance abuse, and depression.\n\nThe good news is that most anxiety disorders get better with therapy. The course of treatment depends on the type of anxiety disorder. Medications, psychotherapy (\"talk therapy\"), or a combination of both can usually relieve troubling symptoms.\n\n\"Anxiety disorders are one of the most treatable mental health problems we see,\" says Dr. Daniel Pine, an NIH neuroscientist and psychiatrist. \"Still, for reasons we don\'t fully understand, most people who have these problems don\'t get the treatments that could really help them.\"\n\nOne of the most common types of anxiety disorder is social anxiety disorder, or social phobia. It affects both women and men equally—a total of about 15 million U.S. adults. Without treatment, social phobia can last for years or even a lifetime. People with social phobia may worry for days or weeks before a social event. They\'re often embarrassed, self-conscious, and afraid of being judged. They find it hard to talk to others. They may blush, sweat, tremble, or feel sick to their stomach when around other people.\n\nOther common types of anxiety disorders include generalized anxiety disorder, which affects nearly 7 million American adults, and panic disorder, which affects about 6 million. Both are twice as common in women as in men.\n\nPeople with generalized anxiety disorder worry endlessly over everyday issues—like health, money, or family problems—even if they realize there\'s little cause for concern. They startle easily, can\'t relax, and can\'t concentrate. They find it hard to fall asleep or stay asleep. They may get headaches, muscle aches, or unexplained pains. Symptoms often get worse during times of stress.\n\nPeople with panic disorder have sudden, repeated bouts of fear—called panic attacks—that last several minutes or more. During a panic attack, they may feel that they can\'t breathe or that they\'re having a heart attack. They may fear loss of control or feel a sense of unreality. Not everyone who has panic attacks will develop panic disorder. But if the attacks recur without warning, creating fear of having another attack at any time, then it\'s likely panic disorder.\n\nAnxiety disorders tend to run in families. But researchers aren\'t certain why some family members develop these conditions while others don\'t. No specific genes have been found to actually cause an anxiety disorder. \"Many different factors—including genes, stress, and the environment—have small effects that add up in complex ways to affect a person\'s risk for these disorders,\" Pine says.\n\n\"Many kids with anxiety disorders will outgrow their conditions. But most anxiety problems we see in adults started during their childhood,\" Pine adds.\n\n\"Anxiety disorders are among the most common psychiatric disorders in children, with an estimated 1 in 3 suffering anxiety at some point during childhood or adolescence,\" says Dr. Susan Whitfield-Gabrieli, a brain imaging expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \"About half of diagnosable mental health disorders start by age 14, so there\'s a lot of interest in uncovering the factors that might influence the brain by those early teen years.\"\n\nWhitfield-Gabrieli is launching an NIH-funded study to create detailed MRI images of the brains of more than 200 teens, ages 14-15, with and without anxiety or depression. The scientists will then assess what brain structures and activities might be linked to these conditions. The study is part of NIH\'s Human Connectome Project, in which research teams across the country are studying the complex brain connections that affect health and disease.\n\nWhitfield-Gabrieli and colleagues have shown that analysis of brain connections might help predict which adults with social phobia will likely respond to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT is a type of talk therapy known to be effective for people with anxiety disorders. It helps them change their thinking patterns and how they react to anxiety-provoking situations. But it doesn\'t work for everyone.\n\nOf 38 adults with social phobia, those who responded best after 3 months of CBT had similar patterns of brain connections. This brain analysis led to major improvement, compared to a clinician\'s assessment alone, in predicting treatment response. Larger studies will be needed to confirm the benefits of the approach.\n\n\"Ultimately, we hope that brain imaging will help us predict clinical outcomes and actually tailor the treatment to each individual—to know whether they\'ll respond best to psychotherapy or to certain medications,\" Whitfield-Gabrieli says.\n\nOther researchers are focusing on our emotions and our ability to adjust them. \"We want to understand not only how emotions can help us but also how they can create difficulties if they\'re of the wrong intensity or the wrong type for a particular situation,\" says Dr. James Gross, a clinical psychologist at Stanford University.\n\nWe all use different strategies to adjust our emotions, often without thinking about it. If something makes you angry, you may try to tamp down your emotion to avoid making a scene. If something annoys you, you might try to ignore it, modify it, or entirely avoid it.\n\nBut these strategies can turn harmful over time. For instance, people with social phobia might decide to avoid attending a professional conference so they can keep their anxiety in check. That makes them lose opportunities at work and miss chances to meet people and make friends.\n\nGross and others are examining the differences between how people with and without anxiety disorders regulate their emotions. \"We\'re finding that CBT is helpful in part because it teaches people to more effectively use emotion regulation strategies,\" Gross says. \"They then become more competent in their ability to use these strategies in their everyday lives.\"\n\n\"It\'s important to be aware that many different kinds of treatments are available, and people with anxiety disorders tend to have very good responses to those treatments,\" Pine adds. The best way to start is often by talking with your physician. If you\'re a parent, talk with your child\'s pediatrician. \"These health professionals are generally prepared to help identify such problems and help patients get the appropriate care they need,\" Pine says.',

    text: 'The ability to manage your emotions and remain calm under pressure has a direct link to your performance. TalentSmart has conducted research with more than a million people, and we\'ve found that 90% of top performers are skilled at managing their emotions in times of stress in order to remain calm and in control.\n\nIf you follow our newsletter, you\'ve read some startling research summaries that explore the havoc stress can wreak on one\'s physical and mental health (such as the Yale study, which found that prolonged stress causes degeneration in the area of the brain responsible for self-control). The tricky thing about stress (and the anxiety that comes with it) is that it\'s an absolutely necessary emotion. Our brains are wired such that it\'s difficult to take action until we feel at least some level of this emotional state. In fact, performance peaks under the heightened activation that comes with moderate levels of stress. As long as the stress isn\'t prolonged, it\'s harmless.\n\nNew research from the University of California, Berkeley, reveals an upside to experiencing moderate levels of stress. But it also reinforces how important it is to keep stress under control. The study, led by post-doctoral fellow Elizabeth Kirby, found that the onset of stress entices the brain into growing new cells responsible for improved memory. However, this effect is only seen when stress is intermittent. As soon as the stress continues beyond a few moments into a prolonged state, it suppresses the brain\'s ability to develop new cells.\n\n\"I think intermittent stressful events are probably what keeps the brain more alert, and you perform better when you are alert,\" Kirby says. For animals, intermittent stress is the bulk of what they experience, in the form of physical threats in their immediate environment. Long ago, this was also the case for humans. As the human brain evolved and increased in complexity, we\'ve developed the ability to worry and perseverate on events, which creates frequent experiences of prolonged stress.\n\nBesides increasing your risk of heart disease, depression, and obesity, stress decreases your cognitive performance. Fortunately, though, unless a lion is chasing you, the bulk of your stress is subjective and under your control. Top performers have well-honed coping strategies that they employ under stressful circumstances. This lowers their stress levels regardless of what\'s happening in their environment, ensuring that the stress they experience is intermittent and not prolonged.\n\nWhile I\'ve run across numerous effective strategies that successful people employ when faced with stress, what follows are ten of the best. Some of these strategies may seem obvious, but the real challenge lies in recognizing when you need to use them and having the wherewithal to actually do so in spite of your stress.\n\nThey Appreciate What They Have\nTaking time to contemplate what you\'re grateful for isn\'t merely the \"right\" thing to do. It also improves your mood, because it reduces the stress hormone cortisol by 23%. Research conducted at the University of California, Davis found that people who worked daily to cultivate an attitude of gratitude experienced improved mood, energy, and physical well-being. It\'s likely that lower levels of cortisol played a major role in this.\n\nThey Avoid Asking \"What If?\"\n\"What if?\" statements throw fuel on the fire of stress and worry. Things can go in a million different directions, and the more time you spend worrying about the possibilities, the less time you\'ll spend focusing on taking action that will calm you down and keep your stress under control. Calm people know that asking \"what if? will only take them to a place they don\'t want—or need—to go.\n\nThey Stay Positive\nPositive thoughts help make stress intermittent by focusing your brain\'s attention onto something that is completely stress-free. You have to give your wandering brain a little help by consciously selecting something positive to think about. Any positive thought will do to refocus your attention. When things are going well, and your mood is good, this is relatively easy. When things are going poorly, and your mind is flooded with negative thoughts, this can be a challenge. In these moments, think about your day and identify one positive thing that happened, no matter how small. If you can\'t think of something from the current day, reflect on the previous day or even the previous week. Or perhaps you\'re looking forward to an exciting event that you can focus your attention on. The point here is that you must have something positive that you\'re ready to shift your attention to when your thoughts turn negative.\n\nThey Disconnect\nGiven the importance of keeping stress intermittent, it\'s easy to see how taking regular time off the grid can help keep your stress under control. When you make yourself available to your work 24/7, you expose yourself to a constant barrage of stressors. Forcing yourself offline and even—gulp!—turning off your phone gives your body a break from a constant source of stress. Studies have shown that something as simple as an email break can lower stress levels.\n\nTechnology enables constant communication and the expectation that you should be available 24/7. It is extremely difficult to enjoy a stress-free moment outside of work when an email that will change your train of thought and get you thinking (read: stressing) about work can drop onto your phone at any moment. If detaching yourself from work-related communication on weekday evenings is too big a challenge, then how about the weekend? Choose blocks of time where you cut the cord and go offline. You\'ll be amazed at how refreshing these breaks are and how they reduce stress by putting a mental recharge into your weekly schedule. If you\'re worried about the negative repercussions of taking this step, first try doing it at times when you\'re unlikely to be contacted—maybe Sunday morning. As you grow more comfortable with it, and as your coworkers begin to accept the time you spend offline, gradually expand the amount of time you spend away from technology.\n\nThey Limit Their Caffeine Intake\nDrinking caffeine triggers the release of adrenaline. Adrenaline is the source of the \"fight-or-flight\" response, a survival mechanism that forces you to stand up and fight or run for the hills when faced with a threat. The fight-or-flight mechanism sidesteps rational thinking in favor of a faster response. This is great when a bear is chasing you, but not so great when you\'re responding to a curt email. When caffeine puts your brain and body into this hyperaroused state of stress, your emotions overrun your behavior. The stress that caffeine creates is far from intermittent, as its long half-life ensures that it takes its sweet time working its way out of your body.\n\nThey Sleep\nI\'ve beaten this one to death over the years and can\'t say enough about the importance of sleep to increasing your emotional intelligence and managing your stress levels. When you sleep, your brain literally recharges, shuffling through the day\'s memories and storing or discarding them (which causes dreams), so that you wake up alert and clear-headed. Your self-control, attention, and memory are all reduced when you don\'t get enough—or the right kind—of sleep. Sleep deprivation raises stress hormone levels on its own, even without a stressor present. Stressful projects often make you feel as if you have no time to sleep, but taking the time to get a decent night\'s sleep is often the one thing keeping you from getting things under control.\n\nThey Squash Negative Self-Talk\nA big step in managing stress involves stopping negative self-talk in its tracks. The more you ruminate on negative thoughts, the more power you give them. Most of our negative thoughts are just that—thoughts, not facts. When you find yourself believing the negative and pessimistic things your inner voice says, it\'s time to stop and write them down. Literally stop what you\'re doing and write down what you\'re thinking. Once you\'ve taken a moment to slow down the negative momentum of your thoughts, you will be more rational and clear-headed in evaluating their veracity.\n\nYou can bet that your statements aren\'t true any time you use words like \"never,\" \"worst,\" \"ever,\" etc. If your statements still look like facts once they\'re on paper, take them to a friend or colleague you trust and see if he or she agrees with you. Then the truth will surely come out. When it feels like something always or never happens, this is just your brain\'s natural threat tendency inflating the perceived frequency or severity of an event. Identifying and labeling your thoughts as thoughts by separating them from the facts will help you escape the cycle of negativity and move toward a positive new outlook.\n\nThey Reframe Their Perspective\nStress and worry are fueled by our own skewed perception of events. It\'s easy to think that unrealistic deadlines, unforgiving bosses, and out-of-control traffic are the reasons we\'re so stressed all the time. You can\'t control your circumstances, but you can control how you respond to them. So before you spend too much time dwelling on something, take a minute to put the situation in perspective. If you aren\'t sure when you need to do this, try looking for clues that your anxiety may not be proportional to the stressor. If you\'re thinking in broad, sweeping statements such as \"Everything is going wrong\" or \"Nothing will work out,\" then you need to reframe the situation. A great way to correct this unproductive thought pattern is to list the specific things that actually are going wrong or not working out. Most likely you will come up with just some things—not everything—and the scope of these stressors will look much more limited than it initially appeared.\n\nThey Breathe\nThe easiest way to make stress intermittent lies in something that you have to do everyday anyway: breathing. The practice of being in the moment with your breathing will begin to train your brain to focus solely on the task at hand and get the stress monkey off your back. When you\'re feeling stressed, take a couple of minutes to focus on your breathing. Close the door, put away all other distractions, and just sit in a chair and breathe. The goal is to spend the entire time focused only on your breathing, which will prevent your mind from wandering. Think about how it feels to breathe in and out. This sounds simple, but it\'s hard to do for more than a minute or two. It\'s all right if you get sidetracked by another thought; this is sure to happen at the beginning, and you just need to bring your focus back to your breathing. If staying focused on your breathing proves to be a real struggle, try counting each breath in and out until you get to 20, and then start again from 1. Don\'t worry if you lose count; you can always just start over.\n\nThis task may seem too easy or even a little silly, but you\'ll be surprised by how calm you feel afterward and how much easier it is to let go of distracting thoughts that otherwise seem to have lodged permanently inside your brain.',
